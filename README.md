# üéõÔ∏è ESP32 Multi-Functional Controller Project

Welcome to the **ESP32 Multi-Functional Controller Project**! This project aims to build a versatile and robust device that integrates multiple communication protocols and input/output methods. This device is designed to handle various tasks, from NFC/RFID scanning to IR communication and Sub-GHz frequency transmission, all controlled via a user-friendly interface on a TFT screen.

## üìö Project Overview

This project combines a powerful ESP32 microcontroller with a range of modules and components to create a fully-featured controller. Below are the main components involved:

- **ESP32 WROOM**: The main brain of the project, offering Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity.
- **TFT Display (ST7735 or ILI9241)**: A colorful interface for displaying information and navigation.
- **PN532 NFC/RFID Module**: Allows for NFC and RFID reading capabilities.
- **IR Receiver & Transmitter**: Adds the ability to send and receive infrared signals.
- **Micro SD Card Module**: For data storage and retrieval, perfect for logging and storing configuration files.
- **CC1101 Sub-GHz Module**: Enables Sub-GHz frequency communication for various applications.
- **Mechanical Buttons**: Provide tactile feedback for navigation, including Up, Down, Left, Right, Select, and Back buttons.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features & Objectives

- **Multi-Protocol Communication**: Combining NFC, IR, and Sub-GHz capabilities in a single device.
- **Data Storage**: Using the Micro SD card for storage, including saved frequencies, configurations, and logs.
- **User-Friendly Navigation**: A TFT display for a clear interface, navigable via mechanical buttons.
- **Flexible & Expandable**: Built with extensibility in mind, so contributors can add support for new modules, protocols, or other features.
